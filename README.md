# Hey, Mohit here üëã

I am a Full Stack Software Developer. I Love to solve problems by building apps.

Every now and then, you'll see me writing a [blog post](https://blog.devesh.tech), documenting my learnings or reading something interesting (I have more books than I could possibly read). If you can't find me doing any of the above, I'll probably be outside on a drive.
